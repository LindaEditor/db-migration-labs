title: 'Creating SQL Server Databases on Compute Engine'
description: In this lab, you will provision a SQL Server machine in a private network. Then, you will create a Windows machine in a public network that you can use to adminstrate the database server. You will also create a Linux client in the public network that can be used to connect to the database. Lastly, you will setup a firewall rule that allows access to the SQL Server database only from the private network.
