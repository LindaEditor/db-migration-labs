title: 'Using Terraform to Create Clients and Servers'
description: In this lab, you will provision a Linux virtual machine in a private network to act as a database server. You will also create a virtual machine that you can use as a bastion host to connect to the database server as an administrator. You will configure the database server for remote connections and add a user account. You will then install the MySQL client software to connect to the database server from a client machine.
